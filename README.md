# Carkir App

Android application that can display information about parking slot information and the exact location of the available parking space

## Introduction

What if we want to park the car, say at the mall. We don't have much time, and there are apps that can provide information about the parking slots in the place. So you no longer need to look for a parking space, just look at your smartphone and then instantly know where your parking destination is. That's our app and how it works.
